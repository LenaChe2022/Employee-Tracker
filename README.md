# Employee-Tracker

## Description

My motivation was to practice working with data base. My aim was to create interface (called **content management systems (CMS)**) that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases.
This is a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
This application allows to to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in the company.
During this project I learned how to work with database.
